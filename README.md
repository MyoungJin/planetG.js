HTML5 Game Engine
========================

This project contains the commercially-proven HTML5 game engine based on canvas and DOM/GPU for mobile devices (Android and iOS).
There are a number of HTML5 game engine out there. We differentiate our engine from others by providing mobile-device performance optimized techniques.
One of them is to support hybrid rendering model of <canvas> and DOM/GPU HW acceleratoin.

Major Features
- require.js based modularization
- mobile device optimized performance including canvas/DOM hybrid rendering context, static object pool
- multi-resolution support for various devicePixelRatio handling
- general game engine feature including sound (WebAudio/Audio tag), Sprite Animation, etc
