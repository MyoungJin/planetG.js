HTML5 Game Engine
========================

This project contains the commercially-proven HTML5 game engine based on canvas and DOM/GPU for mobile devices (Android and iOS).

Even there are a number of open source HTML5 game engines out there, we're proud of our engine by differentiating it from others,
which provides mobile-device optimized performance improvement techniques.
One of them is to support hybrid rendering context of canvas and DOM/GPU.

By capatilizing on the hybrid rendering context, a game based on our engine can be developed to run on even Android 2.3.x and 4.4/4.4.2 (which suffer from severe performance degradation due to Chrome Webview defect).

Major Features
- require.js based modularization
- mobile device optimized performance including canvas/DOM hybrid rendering context, static object pool
- multi-resolution support for various devicePixelRatio handling
- general game engine feature including sound (WebAudio/Audio tag), Sprite Animation, etc

Example Games (Coming Soon)
- Flappy ball
- Piano tiles
- Avoidance (done)
- Baseball
- Basket ball
