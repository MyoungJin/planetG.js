To make a scene in your game, simply call Renderer's makeScene method.
<pre><code class="js">game.renderer.makeScene("introScene",["introBoard"]);
</code></pre>

The first argument is the **name of new scene**, and the second one is an **array of names of [Boards](#board)** to include in the new scene. There is no **Scene** object explicitly accessable by developers, or no property for scene either. The only thing open to developers is the name of the scene. Thus, boards must be created before you create a scene.
